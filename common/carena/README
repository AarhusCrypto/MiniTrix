		CArena - The Network Squid


************************************************************


CArena is a network layer abstracting network communication. We
provide an interface CArena which COO-style object that maintains
connected peers and listens for new connections. 

Notice: CArena is build for one-shot fast execution of a protocol and
exhausts 3 cores of CPU being extremely eager to receive, send and
accept connections. A Server version for long term service of CArena
requires a redesign.
